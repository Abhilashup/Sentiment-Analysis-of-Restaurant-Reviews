# Sentiment-Analysis-of-Restaurant-Reviews

# Motivation
The motivation behind this project is to predict if a review that is given by any customer is positive or negative. Maybe the restaurants can use this to identify which of them are positive and which are negative.

# About
This is a Natural Language Processing Model that can predict the sentiment of the reviews provided by customers who visited a restaurant. The model was built and trained on a dataset which had a number of customer reviews.

# Future Scope
Improve the model even more as there are some words with respect to positive and negative reviews the model isn't predicting quite well. So, maybe adding more reviews to the datasets and re-training the model would help and I'm looking into how the model can be improved by doing so.
